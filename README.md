# ML-Breast-Cancer-Classifiers
This repository contains the solution to the Machine Learning Assignment 4, where we apply various classification algorithms to the Breast Cancer dataset. The goal of the assignment is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

**Project Overview**
The project involves the following steps:

Loading and Preprocessing the Data: The Breast Cancer dataset is loaded, and preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature scaling are applied.
Implementation of Classification Algorithms: The following five classification algorithms are implemented:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Model Comparison: The performance of each model is compared based on accuracy, and we determine which model works best for this dataset.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of multiple classification algorithms on the Breast Cancer dataset. Each model is evaluated, and we compare their accuracy to determine the best performer.
